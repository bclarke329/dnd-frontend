Welcome to my Dungeons & Dragons Character Creator 
========
My name is Bessy Clarke and this is my project for Flatiron's Javascript Module. 

My application is a Dungeons & Dragons Character Creator. It lets a user create a "Party" which they can then use to create charactes that correspondes to parties created. I used the DnD API to fetch character data and append that information to the DOM. 

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create my frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend API. 

Accessing The Application
----------------------
To open the application: 
-Fork and Clone this repository
-Fork and clone the backend repository "https://github.com/bclarke329/dnd-backend-"
-Make sure both tabs are open in your terminal
-To open the frontend, simply run open index.html in your terminal 
-To open the backend, run bundle install, and start the Rails server with "rails s"

Stretch Goals
------------------
-I'd like to add a dice feature that lets users roll for their attributes and modifiers.
-I'd like to improve the general CSS of the application.
